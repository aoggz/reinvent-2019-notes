# SEC323: Building a DevSecOps Culture

## Takeaways

## Notes

Outcomes

- besiness case for devsecops
  - thinking big
- design of your foundational devsecops team
  - starting small
- security mechanisms for devsecops success

Culture

building the narrative to make it successful in the organizations + Automation to reinforce the culture change
driving security ownership
culture = tribal knowledge
is security ownership baked into culture core?

Competing forces:

Dev: build it faster
Security: keep it secure
Ops: keep it stable

90% CEOs believe they will be disrupted
< 15% well-positioned to respond

barriers come from non-technical areas

- culture & valeus
- leadership development
  - how do we manage people to develop
  - what it means to enable upskilling and deving communities of practice
- operating model
  - how work flows through functional-siloed teams is problematic
- security needs equal seat at table w/ org leadership
  - maybe not a head at the table, but at least equal concern
  - be the bar-raiser for security
    - build the culture from the get-go

devsecops achieved by int and automating the enforcement of preventitive, detective and responsive security controls into the pipeline

- frame as cultural transition for team...don't talk about implementation with senior leadership...will devolve into procurement discussion

Tenets of DevSecOps

4. think big, start small --> automatically create a ticket when an alarm triggers

The Benefits

two-day doors:

determine kpis --> correlate release rate with revenue rates, error rates, etc.

traditional it teams

why teams existed:

- funding teams w/ mgrs with same skillsets
- chargebacks, etc.
- ability to understand and articulate why legacy culture/structure existed
  - what project are we going to delay to do this?
  - understand what the risks are and how to mitigate
  - take the aws approach: bulid the press release and FAQ first
    - HIPAA, PII, etc.

Innovation drain

- layout the structure of what needs to be changed

How to influence culture change?

- write down the outcomes you want to achieve.
- How it works at AWS: not gating, consultancy from security
- Not everyone will be able to embed security on a team
  - automation will help here
- Incentives: give rewards for security. bake into perf reviews. make it a positive thing.

Driving change - Areas of focus

- Security = quality
  - treated the same way as defect
  - quality bar that you set security at
    - clear understanding of what the checklist is: articulate the value
      - safer for customer
      - platform to enable newer/safer/faster capabilities

Pitfalls

1. lack of executive sponsorship
   a. not just getting one team onboard. trying to holistically change org.
   a. OR just demonstrate iterative success. not as common.
1. poor communications
   a. across senior leadership, down from senior, what the business value is
   a. builders need to understand new requirements. may get upset, bypass, fight.
   a. how is going to make lives easier
   a. transparency - no black boxes
1. insufficient resource allocation
   a. related to first one. no money put down
   a. tie to existing transofmrational effort. e.g. to cloud, monolith to microservice, etc.
1. undefined kpis and outcomes
1. timing
1. "

What'd make it work at Amazon?

- Everyone's empowered. never hesitate to engage security.
- helps that culture was right from the getgo.
- security is a fewature of the service. insecure services @ AWS are not an option.

Cloud Center of Excellence (CCOE)

- sees across pipelines
- not as affiliated with _a_ team
- has execute sponsor

Define the primitives and get them right. make them reusable.

- wrap all this arround the application teams

Organizational change

- Scurity: saying "no" is seen as a failure. what's your goal...how can we get you there?
  - Make security org think as builders

App sec reviews for our services

- how was your appsec review? good exp/bad exp?

security blind spots

- disparate sources - managing open source libs, partner products, languages, etc.
- lack of rigor
  - Automation can help to enforce rigor.
  - Use ticketing
- can't scale

"get humans away from your data"
