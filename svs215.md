# Chalk talk SVS-215: Build Observability into a Serverless Application

## Takeaways

## Notes

- reltaed breakouts
- obs vs monitoring
  - monitoring: known failure modes (e.g. CPU, memory spikes)
  - observaibilty: lots of information to enable you to debug a complex information
- AWS tools
  - custom metrics (e.g. number of items returned to db, number of items sent to user, etc.)
  - comparatively inexpensive
  - not as good as many 3rd tools
- What alarms should I have?
  - It depends
  - Concurrent executions -> alarm at 80% then ask for a limit raise
  - Lambda
    - Iterator age: time between oldest message and current
    - SQS:
- Commercial tools
  - very low-touch
  - yet another 3rd party
  - expensive
- dazn-lambda-powertools
  - warning/error logging only in production except sample of debug logs
  - python-lambda-powertools
- demo

  - API gateway
  - lambda at root w/ server-side rendering
  - Why site in lambda/API Gateway?
    - since we're doing server-side rendering
    - mainly to demonstrate tracing through
  - Why lambda in front of kinesis stream?
    - not needed here
    - commonly reccommend to do direct API Gateway --> service integration
    - Drawback: no retries like you get if you make a call with the SDK
      - also no monitoring/tracing
      - circuit breaker/fallback patterns not possible
  - Write metrics to CloudWatch logs
    - CloudWatch embedded metric format: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/amazon-cloudwatch-launches-embedded-metric-format/
      - lambda function that watches cloudwatch log groups and publishes custom metrics
      - tracking initduration to optimize coldstart time to not have to pay for cold starts
    - what he's using: SAR called async-custom-metrics
    - metric filters
      - have to recreate for every lambda function
  - Streaming logs to third party
    - Careful that lambda log processor...could easily eat up a ton of concurrent executions
    - Better to stream to kinesis and a lambda that forwards the messages
      - only one lambda concurrently running at any given time with this architecture
  - Serverless application repository: auto-subscribe-log-group-to-arn
    - deploys lambda function to watch for CloudWatch log groups and subscribe them to ARN
  - Why three different correlation ids?
    - use ApiGatewayRequestId as correlation ID since it's returned to the caller
      - can be used by the caller to present to user to contact support with id
  - X-ray doesn't support kinesis
    - supports sns & sqs as async event sources
    - anything on the other side of kinesis (lambda invocation in this case) won't show on the same trace
      - lumigo sdoes support it
  - serverless-lumigo
  - as your use case gets more complicated, start looking at other tools
    - check how much overhead tool provides to a given invocation
  - dashboard
    - event flow shows that the one-to-one message flow is working properly
    - if there's a dip, it's indicative of a problem with a component of the system
  - hystrix - great cross-application dashboard

## Discussion

Anything about monitoring Lambdas at account level and dealing with it? Concurrency limits and such?
How do you find third party tracing tools as compared to X-Ray when it comes to lambda? Not as native of an integration...do you lose some observability there?
