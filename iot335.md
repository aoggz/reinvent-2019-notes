# IOT335: Implementing multi-region AWS IoT

[Demo](https://github.com/aws-samples/reinvent2019-iot335-code)

## Takeaways

- Single thing provisioning (not JiT): decide on region on provision & replicate cert & metadata to other regions
- Just-in-time provisioning: create API to provision device in a region & replicate metadata to other regions
- Application side is tricky if using device shadow: no good way to sync across regions

## Notes

### Why multi-region IoT is desirable

- Shipping globally
  - Not sure where device will come online OR
  - Want to pre-provision device to point to geographically closest endpoint
- Resiliency
  - Ability to failover to multiple regions
- Legal requirements?
  - have to connect to or store data in a given region

### Programmatic provisioning

- Create a small bootstrap program running on device
  - hardcode API gateway url
- when it comes online, sends provisioning request to api gateway,

  - calls lambda
    - gets device ip address
    - looks up location in geolocation database
    - performs distance calculation
    - provisions device in relevant regions
    - add record to dynamodb so given device cannot be provisioned again
    - sends certificate back w/ iot endpoint
      - thing registry, certificate

- JiTR
  - requires
  - iot events published to \$awsEvents when device comes online
  - push update to dynamodb global table
  - lambda triggered from dynamodb update in other region
  - calls step function that registers device in slave region
    - use retry logic to prevent issues with race condition
    - often metadata request (thing type) will be pushed before the thing exists
  - Using ACM as CA
    - unique keys per region
  - certificate will not be stored in slave region
    - since JITR
    - just extra metadata for the device will already be present whenever device connects to slave region

Persisting data

- rules engine can be used to send data to other regions
  - cannot call iot in other region
  - sqs or sns works across regions
    - use in combo w/ lambda
- store in one region and transfer with other
  - s3 cross-region replication
  - kinesis w/ lambdas???
  - dynamodb global tables

Just-in-time registration

- have to build retry logic in your device
  - will be disconnected by iot

### Discussion

- New launch recently: IoT custom endpoints

  - Question: can we failover to another region
    - Use Route 53 w/ health checks in front of IoT? Idk.
  - In preview in us-east-1

- Transferring shadow between regions

  - Lambda triggered in one region that pushes change to other region's IoT device shadow

- Cool use case

  - replicating data from prod to stage via sns
  - similar to replicating across region

- multiple endpoints support coming

- Cert offloading at the load balancer level

  - F5 load balancer acting as a proxy in front of iot service
    - LB, WAF, PROXY
  - Replicating data across regions via equinix connection
  - Active/standby: primary in us-east-1, standby in us-east-2
    - devices are provisioned with knowledge of both endpoints

- What about application side?
  - easy for device to just connect to a different device
  - what if application needs to connect to or push to device?
    - how does it know which region to talk to?
      - Communicate with every region
      - Communicate with desired region then fail over

## Questions to start

- Can IoT devices talk to multiple regions without multiple certs?
  - Can provisioner certs be shared across regions? Is this a good idea?
- Not using JiTR, and provisioning

$aws/events/certificates/registered
$aws/events/presence/connected
\$aws/events/thing/[thing_name]/\*
