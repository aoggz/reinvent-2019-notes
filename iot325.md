# IOT335: Managing security of large IoT fleets with AWS IoT cloud services

## Takeaways

- Think about bidirectional communication

## Notes

### Best pracctices

- Security in design phase
  - Ex. prototypes w/ automove customer
    - Included CISO in pilot
    - Had to change design 30%
    - Better than to happen just before launch
- Use the experts' work
  - Start with their checklist
- Continuous software updates
  - Good for devices in field for long time
- Integrating teams
  - Embedded: device software
  - IoT platform: not just a device. way more than that
  - Keep the teams talking so all security areas of expertise are represented.
    - And to ensure nothing is missed by one of the teams
- Use AWS IoT cloud services best practices
  - don't roll your own

### Amazon FreeRTOS

- Forked FreeRTOS
- Added many security libraries
  - Secure Sockets library
  - PKCS #11 library
    - API to talk to secure element providers (TPM or HSM)
      - to get secrets stored on device
  - Code signing for deployments and OTA
    - Good for updates. Encrypts firmware deployments.
  - Certificate rotation best practices
- How to protect secrets on device

### AWS IoT Greengrass

- Good for IoT device gateway at the edge
- Greengrass role
  - Can assign role to instance to be able to talk to AWS services
- Using HSM through the PKCS#11 interface
- Have to still use best practices for OS-level security
  - Greengrass doesn't help there

### Device management

- Sending events to devices
- Thing groups
  - Can create dynamic thing groups
- Continuous jobs
  - long running job that reacts to changes in thing group
    - e.g. job to recognize old firmware versions added to dynamic thing group and triggering an update
- Digitally sign files that are sent to their devices
  - Integrated with ACM
- X.509 certificate authorization/authentication
- Custom authorizers to build complex auth strategies
  - Can integrate existing strategies with Lambda
  - Lambda will send device credentials

### Device defender

Multi-region?

Revoking cert privileges -- wouldn't that

Runs on client?

- Audit IoT configuratoins
- Provides 10 best practices out of the box. Can add custom ones
- Can set metrics to indicate "normal behvior"
  - service will monitor for abnormal behavior
    - e.g. spike in traffic indicating possible DDOS attack
- Remediation strategies
  - Define actions such as
    - Rebooting
    - Firmware update
    - Revoking privileges
- Run device agent as nonroot dedicated user in its own group
- OS level

### Security of IoT with AWS

## Discussion

- Spikes in traffic on individual clients
  - Detect on topic? No --> per device.
- Mitigation actions
  - Create ticket when two devices detected with the same certificate
- JiTR for consumer products division
  - In manufacturing process, burn bootstrap certificate in production process
    - based on customer-provided CA certficate
  - Create a whitelist file w/ serial #s
  - when a device connects to custom API, lookup client id with whitelist
    - kill connection if client id isn't whitelisted
  - What if device or supplier is compromised?
    - just a bootstrap certificate (blog: bootstrap certificate iot blog)
      - provisioner certificate with very limmited privileges
      - still unique to the device
    - Rotate cert to more privileged cert specific to the device
- 60-90 days is "sweetspot" timeframe for certificate rotation
- What if the device expires?
  - Systems Manager can remote runnel to the device
    - Requires SSM client installed on device
- OTA updates
  - fleet manager pushes new software package
  - define deployment details w/ IoT device management
    - rolling deployment, all at once
  - device informs IoT whether update succeeded or failed
  - Systems Manager or SaltStack/Ansible
