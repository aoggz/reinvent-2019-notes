### Securing containers when you won the infrastructure

- Self-hosted container infrastructure on ECS
  - containers on a host sharing
    - EC2 instance, VPC, AZ, ECS cluster (or any other ochestrator)
- Trust boundaries
  - red and blue containers have different security profiles
- Threat #1: Third-party attacker in application zone
  - Countermeasure: application authorization
    - RBAC
      - API Gateway & IAM authorization
      - RBAC controllers for k8s
    - TLS
    - AWS App Mesh
  - Countermeasure: reduce surface area of attack
    - container image pruning
      - get rid of everything not absolutely needed by the application (e.g. package managers, etc.)
    - network access
      - Limit to only necessary for job access
- Threat #2: Application breaks into hosting instance
  - Countermeasure: Limit application resources access
    - Syscalls and capability pruning (i.e. network administrative apis, etc.)
    - Block access to host resources (i.e. shared file moved to efs)
  - Countermeasure: LStronger isolation beetween applications
    - network isolation
      - fargate requires awsvpc mode - nothing on the host can talk to container, vice versa
    - file system/mount isolation
    - Container runtime sandbox
- Threat #3: Platform security vulnerabilities
  - Countermeasure: Reduce surface area
    - AMI pruning
      - e.g. yum not installed in Fargate AMIs
    - container image pruning
    - network access
  - Countermeasure: Automated patch management
    - Patching in place (using SSM patch manager)
    - Immutable infrastructur & continuous delivery/deployment

#### Demo: Container breakout

### Securing containers when on Fargate

- Each task runs on it's own EC2 instance
- Fargate security model
  - Hardware virtualization
  - Network isolation
    - downloading container images, log streaming, downloading applcation secrets, application traffic
  - Storage isolation
    - ephemeral bound to task lifetime
    - storage isn't encrypted by default
  - Credentials isolation
    - one task = one set of credentials
      - visible oly to task containers
      - containers can be bootstrapped with encrypted secrets
      - AWS CloudTrail can be used to monitor credentials usage
  - Hands-off patching
- Containers don't run as privileged

### A containere's view of the world in Fargate

- world won't look the same to the container as when it runs on a ec2 host

### Monitoring contaiers on Fargate

- Utilization metrics for CPU and memory
- Container Insights
  - Task and container-level metrics
- Task metadata endpoint
  - Can get containers running in the task, get stats for all containers in a task, list task definition & family, etc.
  - 169.254.170.2/v2/stats
  - This is what the DataDog agent does
- application logs
  - log drivers
  - custom log drivers with FireLens

#### Log routing with FireLens

- FireLens container launched for you on Fargate host
  - managed by Fargate team

## Discussion

- Image SHA signing
- ARN to environment variable vs. using secrets manager client in app code
  - security perspective: very similar
    - could be another threat vector in the app
  - customers often opt to not have to manage the sdk in their application code.
