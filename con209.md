^^^ this will live forever

AWS is running the control plane. Mesh is region-specific.

Envoy will report changes back to control plane. Control plane will then inform other consumers.

- Decoupling: bundling transient fault handling into a common library
  - Problem: lib bound to launguage
    - just told no
      - can't use "the right tool for the job"
  - Now just run all those things outside the app
    - A sidecar process running next to the process
    - Handles everything at the network layer

Before: lose request if bad instance
After: dynamically re-route traffic if instance is found to be offline

Everything is launched with default deny

Don't have to manage TLS certificates within the APP. Envoy will take care of it.

CRD: custom resource definition

- created a definition and added it to the k8s cluster

  - now new api path to be able to hit and modify cluster.
  - augments the k8s api with what to expect at certain endpoints and how to repond to requests at those endpoints

Everything that App Mesh does in Fargate is spelled out in how App Mesh is configured in the EC2 setup.

- IP tables, traffic interception, etc.
- Helps with migration from old platform. Add a new virtual node and route traffic to new nodes over time.
