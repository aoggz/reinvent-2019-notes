# Workshop CON209: Using AWS App Mesh to Monitor and Control Your First Containerized App

## Takeaways

- AWS SSM RunCommand - run commands across EC2 instances and keep track of result
- AWS CloudWatch Container insights
- Now-known unknown: Explore ECS Task Sets
- [Workshop site](https://appmeshworkshop.com/) ("this wil live forever")
- Solid strategies for:
  - Migrating apps into App Mesh
  - Replatforming apps incorporated into a mesh

## Notes

### Benefits of app mesh

- Decoupling
- Security
- Fault tolerance

#### Decoupling

- Common pattern: bundling transient fault handling into a common library (written in a certain language)
  - Problem: teams told to standardize around the library vis-Ã -vis the language. Can't use "the right tool for the job"
- Now just run all those things outside the app
  - A sidecar process running next to the process
  - Handles everything at the network layer

#### Security

- Have to explicitly declare which services a virtual node in a mesh can talk to
  - Everything is launched with default deny
- Don't have to manage TLS certificates within the APP. Envoy will take care of it.

#### Fault tolerance

- Before app mesh
  - app sends request
  - dies if backing service instance is offline
  - app receives no response or error response
- After app mesh
  - app sends request through envoy proxy
  - request from envoy times out or receives error if instance is offline
  - envoy re-routes request to another backing sevice node
  - app receives response from backing service

### Control plane

- AWS runs it
- Region-specific
- Propagates configuration changes to registered Envoy instances
  - User-initated (i.e. mesh configuration change)
  - Envoy-instance-initiated (e.g. instance reporting that a virtual node could not be reached)

### Using App Mesh on an VM (EC2 or elsewhere)

- Process is spelled out [here](https://www.appmeshworkshop.com/mesh_frontend/installenvoy/)
  - Does everything that Fargate does when using App Mesh there
    - IP tables, traffic interception, etc.
- Helps with migration from old platform
  - Add new virtual node on a new platform
  - Set routing rules in the service to gradually route traffic to new nodes over time

### Strategy for adding apps into the mesh

- TODO HERE

### Strategy for replatforming apps already in the mesh

- TODO HERE

### Random k8s knowledge

- Custom resource definition (CRD) explained
  - Configuration to define new management API endpoints to be able to hit and modify cluster
  - Augments the k8s api with what to expect at certain endpoints and how to repond to requests at those endpoints
- A custom resource definition is [created for App Mesh in the workshop](https://www.appmeshworkshop.com/mesh_nodejs/install_appmesh_controller/)
